# IMDBProject

When I first started the project, I initially had one goal: to see the most popular genres in foreign countries. Unfortunately, movies can choose up to three genres, yet IMDB doesn't rank which genre comes first. This means that multiple genres can fall under the umbrella of Drama. Crimes, thrillers, fantasy, and more can all, also be drama. This created a map with very little variance.

To overcome this setback,I chose the 2nd highest rated genre for every country, and this showed a more complete picture.

Here you can see how countries like Ireland have grown their animation productions and how crime has become a popular genre.

Since I still did have the data, I decided to add a few more categories that can be found in the full Tableau page.
